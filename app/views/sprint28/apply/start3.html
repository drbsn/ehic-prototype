        <h3>When to apply</h3>
        
      <p>If you have a UK European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) it will be valid until the expiry date on the card. Once it expires, youâ€™ll need to apply for a UK GHIC to replace it. </p>
          
                 <h3>Who can apply</h3>

          <p>During your application you will answer a series of questions about yourself and any spouse, civil partner, durable partner, and children that you add to your application. Based on the information you give us you will be provided with either an UK EHIC or UK GHIC. </p>
    
        
  <h3>Travel insurance and your UK EHIC or UK GHIC </h3>
            <p>Your EHIC or GHIC card is not a substitute for travel insurance. It may not cover all health costs and never covers repatriation costs. Make sure you have travel insurance as well as an UK EHIC or UK GHIC. </p>
