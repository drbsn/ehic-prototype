      <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">Apply now for a new UK European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">You’ll be able to use your new card as soon as you get it, for travel before the end of 2020 and from 1 January 2021.</p>

      <h3>EHIC from 1 January 2021</h3>

      <p>Under the Withdrawal Agreement, certain people are eligible for a new UK EHIC.</p>

      <p>You can apply now for a new UK EHIC if you have a registered S1, E121, E106 or E109 form because you either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>receive a qualifying pension or benefit</li>
        <li>are a family member (a dependant) of someone with a qualifying pension or benefit</li>
        <li>are a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another) before 31 December 2020, for as long as you continue to be a frontier worker in the host state</li>
        <li>are a family member of a frontier worker</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can also apply now if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are a UK national who ordinarily resides in the UK and will be studying in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland before 31 December 2020 and will still be studying in that country from 1 January 2021</li>
        <li>are a national of a non-EEA country who has paid the Immigration Health Surcharge (or is exempt) and ordinarily resides in the UK but will be studying in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein or Switzerland before 31 December 2020 and will still be studying in that country from 1 January 2021</li>
      </ul>

      <p>An EHIC is for healthcare when you travel. You only need to apply for a new card if you have an S1, E121, E106 or E109 and are planning to visit another EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland.</p>
      <p>If you are an EU national ordinarily resident in the UK before 31 December 2020, you may be eligible to apply for an EHIC that is valid from 1 January 2021. We will be accepting applications from EU nationals in the UK in due course. Your current EHIC will remain valid until 31 December 2020.</p>



      <h3>What EHIC covers</h3>

      <p>The new UK EHIC will cover you for all medically necessary, state-provided healthcare when visiting another EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland.</p>
      <p>You can use your EHIC to cover you for any medically necessary, state-provided healthcare.</p>
      <p>Unless you are a student you can use your EHIC in any EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland, except for the country you live in and the UK.</p>


      <h3>UK students using a UK EHIC</h3>

      <p>If you are a UK student studying in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland before 31 December 2020, you can use your EHIC to get medically necessary, state-provided healthcare within the country you are studying.</p>
      <p>You must select the country you will be studying in on 31 December 2020.</p>
      <p>You will only be able to use your EHIC in that country. This will be identified on the card. You cannot use your EHIC to access healthcare in any other country after 31 December 2020, even if you move to study in another country.</p>


      <h3>The application process</h3>

      <p>By applying now, you’ll receive your new UK EHIC before 31 December 2020.</p>
      <p>You’ll need to answer a series of questions and to register your details. If we need further evidence to support your application, we’ll email you with advice on what to do next.</p>
      <p>Once we receive your application and any evidence we ask for, we’ll process your application and respond to you within 5 working days.</p>
      <p>If you are not entitled to a new UK EHIC, we’ll let you know during the application process or within 5 working days of receiving your application and any requested evidence.</p>
