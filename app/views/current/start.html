        Use this service to apply for an EHIC (European Health Insurance Card). An EHIC gives you the right to access state-provided healthcare on temporary stays in countries in the EU/EEA and Switzerland.

      <ul>
        <li>You are a UK citizen</li>
        <li>You are an EU citizen with settled or pre-settled status (indefinite leave to remain in the UK)</li>
