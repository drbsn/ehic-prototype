          <h5>The European Economic Area (EEA)</h5>
          <p>
            The EEA includes EU countries and also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. It allows them to be part of the EUâ€™s single market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Switzerland is not an EU or EEA member but is part of the single market. This means Swiss nationals have the same rights to live and work in the UK as other EEA nationals.
