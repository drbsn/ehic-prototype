    <p>You’ll need to register your S1 with your local authorities. We’ve included information about how to do this with your S1.</p>

    <p>You may need to download and print a copy of this document for it to be accepted when you register it. If you do, we recommend using a colour printer.</p>

    <p>If you’ve asked for a copy by post, you can use this when you receive it.</p>
