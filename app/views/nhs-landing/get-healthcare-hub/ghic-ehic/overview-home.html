        There are 2 types of cover available.

      <p>
        Depending on your circumstances, you can get either:
        <!-- You can apply for either: -->
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)</li>
        <li>a UK European Health Insurance Card (UK EHIC), if you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement</li>

      <p>
        For most people, the UK Global Health Insurance Card (UK GHIC) replaces the existing European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) for new applications.

      <p>A UK GHIC and new UK EHIC are free of charge. Beware of unofficial websites, they may charge you a fee to apply.</p>

      <p>You can get a Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC) to prove your entitlement to medically necessary healthcare if you travel to Europe without your existing EHIC, UK GHIC or new UK EHIC and need treatment during your visit.</p>

      <p>If you need a PRC outside opening hours, you should call as soon as possible the next working day.</p>
      <p>The PRC will give you the same cover as an existing EHIC, UK GHIC or new UK EHIC until you return home.</p>
      <p>When calling for a PRC, you'll need to give:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>your National Insurance number</li>
        <li>your name</li>
        <li>your address</li>

      <!-- <h2>Claiming a refund</h2>

      <p>Depending on the country you visit you may be expected to pay all or part of your bill upfront and then claim a refund afterwards.</p>
      <p>Some countries ask patients to pay a contribution towards the cost of their care, such as for prescription costs. This is known as a co-payment or patient share.</p>
      <p>You can claim back the difference between the total bill and the co-payment, but the actual co-payment is not refundable.</p>
      <p>Keep all receipts and any paperwork. You or your insurance company may need them if you're applying for a refund.</p>

      <h2>What to do if you believe your existing EHIC, UK GHIC or new UK EHIC has been wrongly rejected</h2>

      <p>If you believe that your UK GHIC, new UK EHIC or existing EHIC has been wrongly rejected by a hospital or other healthcare provider in the country you're visiting, you should try and resolve the issue with them.</p>
      <p>Explain that the card entitles the holder to necessary healthcare. It may be useful to direct them to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=653&langId=en">European Commission's EHIC webpage</a>, which provides images of all valid UK-issued EHICs and the UK GHIC.</p>
      <p>If you need more help, <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-us/overseas-healthcare-services-contact-us">contact NHS Overseas Healthcare Services</a>. They can give you advice on what to do.</p>

      <h2>What to do if you think you've been incorrectly charged for medical treatment by an EU Member State or Switzerland</h2>

      <p>It's important that you keep documents relating to your treatment. The Overseas Healthcare Services at the NHSBSA may ask you for more information to check your eligibility and the cost of the treatment you had. This could include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>receipts or invoices relating to treatment</li>
        <li>confirmation of payments made to healthcare institutions</li>
        <li>documents relating to insurance cover if your insurer paid for treatment</li>
        <li>discharge documents</li>
      </ul>

      <p>They'll look at your claim to decide whether you were charged when you should have been covered. If they determine that your treatment should have been covered by the UK GHIC, new UK EHIC or existing EHIC, they’ll reimburse you or your insurer for the costs of treatment which are covered by your card. This may not include the full cost of treatment.</p>
